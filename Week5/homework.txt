# Homework 5
## To Do:

1. Move the home directory to a new partition on a new disk.

2. Add swap space to your machine.

3. Change the ssh message of the day of your machine to be three sentences explaining why someone would move their home
directory to a new partition, and a bit of text explaining what swap space is and why you would want it. 

4. Configure a user account that I can ssh into to verify your assignment.

## Grading:
0% or 100%, should be a straight forward assignment. To get a 100% I want to be able to login to your machine as:
username: melvyn
password: melvyn

I'm going to ssh in. I expect to see:
1. `lsblk` shows the home directory on a different partition
2. `lsblk` shows swap space
3.  When I login the indicated ssh banner should be there.
