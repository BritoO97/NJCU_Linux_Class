# Homework 5
## To Do:

1. Move the home directory to a new partition on a new disk.

2. Add swap space to your machine.

3. Change the ssh message of the day of your machine to be three sentences explaining why someone would move their home
directory to a new partition, and a bit of text explaining what swap space is and why you would want it.

## Grading:
0% or 100%, should be a straight forward assignment.

Configure a new vm to satisfy the above criteria. Log in to the machine via ssh and run the following commands:

```
$uptime
$lsblk
$free -h
$curl ipinfo.io/ip
```

Then take a screenshot or a picture with your phone showing the ssh banner, and the output of the indicated commands. Pull request the picture in a directory called $yourName under Week5. Same as for week 4. 

Expectations:
uptime should be less than 1 hour. I want you to configure this machine in just a few minutes.
lsblk should show the home partition, maybe the swap space.
free should definitely show the swap space.
everyone's homework should be different, I'm verifying this via your ip address.

See my sample submission in the Week5 directory.
