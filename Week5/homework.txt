Three Todos:

1. Move your home directory to a new partition on a new disk.

2. Add swap space to your machine.

3. Change the ssh banner of your machine to be a brief bit of text explaining why someone would move their home directory to 
a new partition, and a bit of text explaining what swap space is and why you would want more of it.

Grading:
I'm going to log into your machine. I want to see swap space, a home directory on a new partition, and the indicated 
ssh banner.

[TBD] Considering doing a screen share on discord, never did it before. I figure if we do a screen share I can verify that
you know how to do this assignment! Will update soon.
