Create a repo on that machine containing a few cool ascii cats from here:

Email me a few short sentences about what git is and the importance of version control, as well as instructions for how I can clone the repo to my laptop to verify your repo works.

I've added my id_rsa.pub to this repo so you can put it on the server.

To pass this assignment:
1. I must be able to clone the repository from your machine and see that there are some nice looking cats in the repo, in files like tabby.txt, kitty.txt, etc.

2. You must convince me in a paragraph or less that you have a rough idea of the importance of version control.
