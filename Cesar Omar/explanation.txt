Greetings Professor,

Ok, to the best of my knowledge and what i have read online and some other resource materials, "rm" Command is the fastet way to delete a folder."RM" which is short for "remove" is a basic command on Unix operating system. 
This command can not also delete folders but the entire contents within the folder. However, the problem can be very critical as one typo may damage the entire system completely.
