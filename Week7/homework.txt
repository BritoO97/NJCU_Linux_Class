Homework:

1. Find and install a non-free software package on debian 9 by modifying your sources.list file. *Note*: non-free means non-free. 0 credit for installing a contrib package. 0 credit for installing a main package. It must be a non-free package!!!

2. Install curl from source to /usr/local/bin. When you run curl on the command line by typing 'curl' which version of curl is run? 

3. Write an https request with curl to hit a the reddit rest API. If the version you compiled doesn't work, just use the one available by default. You may get an error response "too many request". You need to use oauth2 to make the requests with more reliability.

Some references:
  https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/43z4gp/get_top_posts_in_json_from_subreddit_with_curl/

  Example curl request:
  curl -X GET -L https://www.reddit.com/r/TellMeAFact/top/.json?count=20

  What's a rest API? There is some good discussion o it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/40lfkn/eli5_rest_api/ . Or you can just google it. 

4. Write a hash algorithm that takes inputs and returns: 
  a. If the input is non-numeric: 0
  b. If the input is even: 1
  c. If the input is odd: 2
