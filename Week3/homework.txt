Problem 1.
You are a hacker.
You want to run some jobs overnight on your victim's machine while they aren't at work so they don't notice the heavy load on their machine.

Add files, brief scripts / explanatory notes / etc. illustrating how you would do this ( A brief explanation in text along with the system changes. If the only change you made was to apt-get some software, then write that. If the only change you made was to configure a cron job to send the appropriate signal to a user's processes, then tell me about that.
