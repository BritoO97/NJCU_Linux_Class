Problem 1.
You are a hacker.
You want to run some jobs overnight on your victim's machine while they aren't at work so they don't notice the heavy load on their machine.
Implement a way to stop all of a user's jobs at 9AM everyday and restart them at 5PM.

Fork and clone the NJCU_Linux_Class repo, add your solution under Week3/YourName

Add files, brief scripts / explanatory notes / etc. illustrating how you would do this. Make a pull request to the class repo before 7PM on valentine's day. ( A brief explanation in text along with the system changes. If the only change you made was to apt-get some software, then write that. If the only change you made was to configure a cron job to send the appropriate signal to a user's processes.

Problem 2.
Play with github. Clone some software, create repos, fork some repos, submit pull requests, reread the git book, whatever. Get yourself well acquainted with git. 

Read Chapters 1 and 2 of ProGit. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 . For the rest of the class you are expected to have a working understanding of git and eventually you will be tested. Read the chapters and start using git to get comfortable with this tool.
