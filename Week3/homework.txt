You are a hacker.
You want to run some jobs overnight on your victim's machine while they aren't at work so they don't notice to heavy load on their machine.
Implement a way to stop all of a user's jobs at 9AM everyday and restart them at 5PM.

Fork and clone the NJCU_Linux_Class repo, add your solution under Week3/YourName

Add files, brief scripts / explanatory notes / etc. illustrating how you would do this. Make a pull request to the class repo before 7PM on valentine's day.
