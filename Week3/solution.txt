Problem 1.

The gist of the problem is: implement a way to stop all of a user's jobs at 9AM everyday and restart them at 5PM. 
You already did this in hw 2.

We covered cron jobs in class, you use cron to schedule jobs.

Use crontab -e to add this cron job:

* 9 * * * ps -u username_here | cut -c 1-5 | xargs kill -STOP
* 17 * * * ps -u whatever_username_you_targeted_above | cut -c 1-5 | xargs kill -STOP

Problem 2.
Just read and practice. Note that I said to read only Ch1&2 of the git book - the book is long and complicated
but ch 1 & 2 are relatively the same as what we did in class.
