# Final Exam

Set up a git server on a machine so I can clone some cool code from it.
[gitlab front end?]
Start with a VM from scratch, configure it as a git server using whatever notes you want. 
For credit I must be able to clone from it during class.

Any suggestions on what the repo should contain?

Grading:
Pass/fail. 0/100.
