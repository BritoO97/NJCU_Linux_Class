Recommended reading/viewing:

In general there is an overabundance of reading material on the internet about Linux/Unix and, as we discussed, you sometimes don't even need to go anywhere to learn - right there in your terminal you have `--help` and `man COMMAND` to get answers about different linux tools. 

Nevertheless, for reading I recommend:
1. Evi Nemeth's "UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook (5th Edition)" - this is a very praised book about Linux system administration.
2. Christopher Negus - "Linux Bible" - another great book with lots of information about Linux.
3. Dave Taylor and Brandon Perry - "Wicked Cool Shell Scripts 2nd Ed" - a huge collection of cool bash programs with explanations of how they work.
