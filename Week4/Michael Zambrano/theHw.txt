The Rm command is so powerful because there is no way back from what ever you delete. 
a good example of the rm command would be rm -rf this will delete everything in the directory without a warning.
that is why an Alias for the rm command can be of help. an example of one can be "remove = rm -i -rf " this will question you before actual removing the file.
