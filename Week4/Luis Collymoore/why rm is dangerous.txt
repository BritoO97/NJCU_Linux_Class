rm (Remove)

Is a very dangerous command that can delete specific files or directories. In Unix, the use of rm is especially risky because there is no undelete command, so once deleted, itâ€™s unrecoverable. If privileged user escalates his privileges to sudo and decides to use rm, then he could permanently remove sensitive and valuable data from the system.
