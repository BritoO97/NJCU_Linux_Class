Make a pull request on my repository. The pr should contain a directory which contains:

    a) a .txt file explaining in 3 sentences why rm is a dangerous command.

    b) A bashrc file ( we'll call it bashrc and not .bashrc just so it's easier to commit the file )
    
        containing
            1. an alternative to rm ( either an alias or a function
            2. aliases for 3 directories so it's easier to cd to them
            3. a function that does something

When I clone the repo on Thursday night after class I want to see it laid out like this:


    student1
        explanation.txt
        bashrc
    student2
        explanation.txt
        bashrc
    student3
        ... etc ...
