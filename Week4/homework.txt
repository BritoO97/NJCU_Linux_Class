Make a pull request on my repository. The pr should contain a directory which contains 6 files:

    a) a .txt file explaining in 3 sentences why rm is a dangerous command.

    b) A bashrc file ( we'll call it bashrc and not .bashrc just so it's easier to commit the file )
    
        containing
            1. an alternative to rm ( either an alias or a function
            2. aliases for 3 directories so it's easier to cd to them
            3. a function that does something
        
    c) a bash program you wrote that uses a while loop
    
    d) a bash program you wrote that uses a for loop
    
    e) a bash program that uses an "if" statement with the "test" command
    
    f) a shell script that can be run with the bash interpreter, but which will not run with sh.

    student1
        explanation.txt
        bashrc
        prog1.sh
        prog2.sh
        prog3.sh
        prog4.sh
    student2
        explanation.txt
        bashrc
        prog1.sh
        prog2.sh
        prog3.sh
        prog4.sh
