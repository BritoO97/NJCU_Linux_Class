# Extra credit one

This homework has three parts

## Part One

Create a patterns.txt file to work with the provided script.sh. 
The output in the terminal should be:

| 4
| 3
| 2
| 0

Each iteration of the while loop should delete one line from file.txt based on a regular expression you write into patterns.txt.

## Part Two
Write 5 different bash one liners that use 3 pipes each.

## Part Three
Run program.py in such a way that two files are created - stdout.txt and stderr.txt. The contents of stdout.txt should contain
the stdout output for program.py. The contents of stderr.txt should contain the stderr output from program.py.

## How to submit. 
Create a directory under EC_01 with your name. Inside the directory there should be three files: 

1. patterns.txt
2. bashOneliners.sh
3. redirect.sh

Everyone should have a different #2.
